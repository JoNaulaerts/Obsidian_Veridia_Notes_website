"sprookje" over een vloek waar ze zich jaren tegen wilde beschermen.

Once upon a time, in the quiet hills of Larkspire, there stood a grand castle, its towers reaching high into the sky and casting shadows over the land. The people of Lark knew that as the sun set and night fell, the shadows grew long, hiding secrets in their dark folds. And the darkest secret of all was of The Lady of the Pale Veil.

Long ago, this castle was plagued by a wraith—a restless soul who wandered the halls in search of the living, known only by her haunting, whispering voice and her chilling touch. She was said to be the spirit of a lady betrayed, her heart twisted by sorrow and vengeance. No one knew her true name, but she wore a tattered veil, pale as moonlight, trailing behind her like a shroud.

Her presence was felt most on moonless nights, when the wind would carry her mournful, sighing whispers through the corridors. Those who heard it would freeze in place, for it was said her voice was a deathly call, luring her prey to her. Those poor souls who encountered her didn’t stand a chance—she would draw close, her cold fingers reaching out, and with a touch, she’d drain the life from them, leaving them pale and empty, their souls bound to her for eternity.

For years, the people of Larkspire lived in fear, locking their doors and windows at night, whispering prayers that The Lady would pass them by. But one night, a powerful warrior arrived, a stranger to the castle yet undeterred by the tales of horror. He was brave, strong, and wise in the ways of the supernatural. He carried with him a blade forged by sacred hands, a sword that glowed with a fierce light.

This warrior, knowing the castle’s many secrets, ventured deep into the heart of Larkspire, following the faint traces of her cold presence. At last, he found her, standing by a tall, cracked mirror in the castle’s oldest chamber, her veil swirling around her like a mist. With a cry, he struck out with his blade, and the two battled with such force that the very walls trembled. But the warrior’s light was too strong, and finally, with a final, piercing scream, The Lady was banished from the castle.

But she was not destroyed. No, the warrior knew her spirit was too strong to be fully vanquished, so he sealed her away in a tomb, far beneath the gardens of Larkspire. Beneath a statue of the very warrior who had defeated her, he laid a powerful enchantment over her resting place, so that her dark soul would remain trapped.

To this day, the people of Lark avoid the gardens on dark nights, and children are warned to never approach the statue, for fear that her whispers might escape. They say that if you listen closely enough on a moonless night, you can still hear her soft, mournful song, calling out from beneath the ground, waiting for the day when someone is foolish enough to break the seal and let her walk free once more.
